This is a collection of sub procedures and functions which I've created and implemented whilst administrating the Corporate Credit Card program of a well-known conglomerate. The majority of the code is related to automating the sending of notification emails from MS Access and Excel.

There are several PERSONAL.XLSB sub procedures included which I also run on a daily basis.
